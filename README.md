# predicting-housing-rents-Bangladesh
In this project, over 90k rent listings in Bproperty.com from throughout different cities of Bangldesh will be analyzed. The main objective here is to build a model that will predict the rent of an apartment with maximum possible accuracy.

This predictive model will be beneficial for:
1. **Individual real estate owners:** Individuals owning an apartment and willing to rent it out to others, can benefit from this model, as, properties can be rented in a free       competitive marketplace only if it is rented at or less than the competitive market price. If the property is rented less than the market price then the owner will lose out on some money. On the other hand, if the asking rent is more than the market price then people will not pay for this property.
2. **Tenants:** Like the landlord, tenants can benefit from this model as well. Moreover, if an indidual wants to rent an house or flat in a particular location according to their personal need of number of bedroom and bathroom, and area of the house, they can easily predict the rent using this model.
3. **Real estate companies:** Real estate companies willing to undertake projects in a particular location can easily predict what the rent will be given their specification. This will help the companies evaluate the project before investing more accurately.
